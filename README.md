## Introduction
This project references this paper:
"BMBC: Bilateral Motion Estimation with Bilateral Cost Volume for Video Interpolation"
[Online]: https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123590103.pdf

BMBC aims at create a middle frame between two frames.
I extend this project to encrpted cipher in the created middle frame.
